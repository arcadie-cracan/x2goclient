Building
==================

Edit the Makefile to suit your needs.

Variables that may need modifications are:

Variables that are being used by the install targets called later and might
need modifications are:
  - PREFIX
  - ETCDIR

Everything else should be left as-is.

On Linux-based systems, run:

make all

or

make build_client

to build X2Go Client.


Installing
==================

On Linux-based systems, run:

make install

to install X2Go Client.

Alternatively, use one of the targets:
  - install_client: for X2Go Client only
  - install_man: for the man pages only


Uninstalling
==================

On Linux-based systems, use the same procedure as lined out in the "Installing"
section, but replace "install" with "uninstall".
