Translating X2Go Client
======================

Translating with Qt-Linguist
------------------------

X2Go Client uses Quick Translation mechanism (.qm, .ts files).
The translation files can be found in the main folder of X2Go Client of this source project.


New team member --- new language for X2Go Client
-----------------------------------------------
If you are a new member in the x2go-i18n team, the first we say is: WELCOME!!! and
THANKS!!! for the time you give to the X2Go project.

And, if you are new to the team and language files for the language you want to feel
responsible for do not yet exist, please subscribe to this mailing list first:

  https://lists.x2go.org/listinfo/x2go-i18n

Once you are subscribed, send an email to

  x2go-i18n@lists.x2go.org

that explains your willingness to translate this-and-that language.

The developers will then provide a language file for you in the above mentioned /po
folder.


Git cloning
-----------
Next thing to do is to obtained the latest sources from X2Go Git.

  $ # git needs to be installed, on Debian/Ubuntu this is
  $ aptitude install git       # <----for debian
  $ sudo apt-get install git   # <----for ubuntu
  $ # then checkout the code
  $ git clone git://code.x2go.org/x2goclient.git

In your current working directory there should now be a subfolder named ,,x2goclient''.


Creating Your Language File
---------------------------
First, copy the file x2goclient_de.ts, for instance via the terminal.

You can do this by running the following commands:

1. cd x2goclient/res/i18n

2. cp x2goclient_de.ts "x2goclient_da.ts <or what language your going to translate it into>".

Now, the file is ready for editing to your desired language.


Editing Your Language File
--------------------------
The tool needed for editing qt translation files is ,,linguist-qt4''

  $ open Ubuntu Software Center, search for ,,Qt 4 Linguist'' and install it from there  # <--for ubuntu

Now open your language file in <current_dir>/x2goclient/res/i18n/x2goclient_<lang>.ts and edit it with
linguist-qt4.

NOTE: Make sure you translate all boldly marked items: non-translated as well as fuzzy
(i.e., inaccurate) items.



Sending in the Translation File
-------------------------------
When done, please send the complete translation file

  <current_dir>/x2goclient/res/i18n/x2goclient_<lang>.ts

to x2go-i18n@lists.x2go.org and remove your working copy of X2Go Client from
your system (or read how to use Git and keep the folder.)


Next time...
------------
You will get informed on x2go-i18n if a translation update is necessary. So check
your mails there regularly.

For updating a translation, keep the X2Go Client source project folder and read
more about Git by yourself.

Alternatively, just remove the folder (once you have sent in the translation file)
and start with this documentation all over again.

THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME!!!

light+love,
